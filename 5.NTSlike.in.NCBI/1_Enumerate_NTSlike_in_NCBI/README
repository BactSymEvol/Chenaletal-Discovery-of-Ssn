This analysis searches for NTS and NTSlike elements in the NCBI reference/representative database and also searchs for homologs of the
Nm 8013 protein SSnA (CAX49033.1) in thos same databases using 2 different homology criteria.
1. Any homolog present with E value < 1e-10
2. Any homolog present with E value < 1e-10 and percentage of identity > 60%
Homologs identifed without wtih reference only to the GIy-YIG gene subfamily to which SSNA belongs are indentified usign
3. PSI blast homolog present based on the PSSM for this subfamily (CD10448)
4. PSI blast homolog present based on the PSSM for this subfamily (CD10448), and for which reverse PSI blast identifies as the protein belonging to CD100448 with a score of > 100

Extracted flanking regions of 5000bp from all homologs based on the above criteria are also extracted for downstream analysis
