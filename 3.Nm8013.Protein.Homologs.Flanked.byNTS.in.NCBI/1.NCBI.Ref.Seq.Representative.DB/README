To conduct this analysis, the user would have to download the genomic .fna and 
predicted CDNAs and proteome files for each of the RefSeq genomes assembly IDs in the accompanying file.
In the format retrieved by NCBI "datasets" command
Folder with GCF_* number, and the sequence data in:
- Genomic sequence in X_genomic.fna
- CDS in cds_from_genomic.fna
- Proteins in proteins.faa
From the Ref Seq DB
Then BLAST, samtools and exonerate indicies need to be generated.
Scipts:
- make.ncbi.db.sh : Script to bulid blastDB and indicies
For reasons of space, the downloaded genomes are not included in this supplement
