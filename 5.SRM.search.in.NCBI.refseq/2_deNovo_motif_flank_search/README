Proceedure for GLAM2-based de novo identifcation of motifs in the regions flanking homologs of Ssna

1. tblastn of SSna (Nm 8013) against our representative/reference genome DB (17000 bacteria)
2. All proteins homologous with SSNa with > 75% min alignment length, e-value 1e-10 (top hit per genome) extracted = 2804 genomes
3. Extract the 5000 5' and 3' genomic regions flanking the Ssna homolog in each genome (10 kbp per genome, 2804 genomes)
4. Run Glam2 to identify de novo motifs in the 10kpb flanking region. (Glam2 will find exactly attempt to find 1 motif per input sequences)
5. Result: Glam2 output and multiple sequence alignment of the top motif found in ALL input flanking regions
